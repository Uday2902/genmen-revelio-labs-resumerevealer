  <p>This is final notebook which includes fine tunned spacy model along with O*NET LSTM model</p>
  <h4>Dependencies : </h4>
  <p>Spacy fine tunned model : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uday2902/resume-parser </p>
  <p>You need to import this model to classify different sections from resume. </p>
